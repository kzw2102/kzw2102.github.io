## Current Academic Standing 
I am a second year Master of Public Health student at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health in the biostatistics department. I recieved a BS in Health: Science, Society, and Policy from [Brandeis University](http://brandeis.edu) in December of 2017. 

## What do I do during my free time 

In my free time I like to do the following:

### Read Books 

I absolutely love reading. My 2019 Goodreads goal is to read 20 books. So far I have read 17 books as of October 29, 2019. 

My favorite book so far is Nightgale by Kristin Hannah.

### Bullet Journaling

I am a very crafty person and thoroughly enjoy bullet journaling. This is one of my favorite spreads from the summer.
